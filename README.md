# Funny Neko Giver
A simple .NET Framework WinForms application made for the primary goal of getting images and gif files from different image distribution services, such as [nekos.fun](https://www.nekos.fun), [nekos.best](https://nekos.best), [nekos.api](https://nekosapi.com).

**Attention!** Be careful while using these APIs in this application, as some of them tend to send unfiltered images with both safe and non-safe content.
